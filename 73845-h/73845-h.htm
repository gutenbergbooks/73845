  <h2 class='c006'>Mr. C. Francis Jenkins</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Born in the country, north of Dayton, Ohio, in
1868, of Quaker parents. Spent boyhood on farm
near Richmond, Indiana. Attended country school;
a nearby high school; and Earlham College. “Explored”
wheatfields and timber regions of Northwest,
and cattle ranges and mining camps of Southwest
United States. Came to Washington, D. C., in
1890, and served as secretary to Sumner I. Kimball,
U. S. Life Saving Service. Resigned in 1895 to take
up inventing as a profession. Built the prototype
of the motion picture projector now in every picture
theatre the world over; developed the spiral-wound
paraffined all-paper container; and produced the first
photographs by radio, and mechanism for viewing
distant scenes by radio. Has over three hundred
patents; and maintains a private laboratory in
Washington. He is a member of the Franklin Institute,
the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, and founder of the Society of Motion
Picture Engineers. Has several times been honored
by scientific and other bodies for original research
and attainment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>Foreword</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The rapid development of apparatus for the transmission
of photographs by wire and by radio may
now be confidently expected, because the public is
ready for it. At this very moment it is going through
the same empirical process by which motion pictures
arrived, and out of which finally the long film strip
was born.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the motion picture development there appeared
the spiral picture disc; the picture “thumb book”;
picture cards radially mounted on drums and bands;
and the picture film continuously moved and intermittently
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c008'>But finally the development resolved itself into a
single, long, transparent picture film, intermittently
moved in the exposure aperture of the projecting
machine; and upon this has been built one of the
large industries of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doubtless this will be the history of the development
of electrically transmitted photographs, and of
radio vision, for many schemes have already been
tried and more may yet be seen before the final,
practical form shall have been evolved, and this new
aid to business and to entertainment shall have taken
its place in human affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The transmission of a photograph electrically, a
portrait, for example, is not so much a matter of
mechanism, once the tools are perfected and their
operation understood; it is more a matter of blending
of line and tone, just exactly as it is with the artist.
The great portrait photographer uses the same tools
the amateur uses, but an acquired technique of high
order enables him to produce a superior portrait,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>free of chalky contrasts, and soft in tone and blending.
Just so in radio photography, it is a matter of
simple mechanism, and an acquired skill in its use.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author expects to see, very soon, the radio
amateurs using flash-light lamps and electric pens
where they now use headphones; and halftones or
potassium cells where they now use microphones,
for the radio problem between the two is practically
the same—if anything rather more simple with
light than with sound. And new means for modulating
electric current by changing light values may be
expected when the American boy starts to play with
this new toy.</p>

<p class='c008'>There has been a veritable army of engineers
engaged in the development of radio as a service to
the ear, while relatively few engineers have been
developing radio as a service to the eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is believed that the distant electric modulation
of light for many purposes will soon become a common
phenomena and eventually of inestimable service in
science, in engineering, in industry, and in the home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor will this service be confined to radio. Present
metallic channels now employed for other purposes,
<i>i. e.</i>, high tension power lines, railroad rails, city
lighting wires, and water pipes, can be made a new
source of revenue, and at a ridiculously insignificant
cost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Radio is none the less valuable by reason of its
application as such a rider on the present metallic
grids of every city, and of interurban connections.
There are many channels where only space radio can
be employed, but the neglect of the application of
high frequency currents to metallic channels which
lead into every place of business, and into every
home, is unnecessary waste.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author confidently believes the application of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>these several ideas to the control of light at distant
points is the next great advance in electricity, and to
hasten such development the information in the
following pages is set down to assist the research
worker and the application engineer. The mechanisms
and circuits herein disclosed may be accepted
with assurance.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a radio photographic technique, the result of
ten years of concentration on this subject, it may be
asserted with confidence that the requirement of a
particular application rather than a particular
machine is the governing factor in each case; for
with full working knowledge of the art, and the
special application requirements known, the design
of the machine best adapted to that service is a
simple matter.</p>

    <div>C. FRANCIS JENKINS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The earliest attempts to send pictures and to see
electrically date back some fifty years, being
practically coincident with efforts to transmit sound
electrically.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first a metallic circuit was employed to carry
the impulses representing picture values, but when
radio was available several workers immediately
began the adaptation of their apparatus to radio
circuits.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some remarkably fine examples of pictures transmitted
by both wire and radio have been produced
in recent months; most of them showing the lines,
but some of them without lines at all, <i>i. e.</i>, true
photographic results.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as the transmission of images from living
subjects in action differs from “still” pictures only
in that they are more rapidly formed, it naturally
followed that the solution of this problem should
also be undertaken.</p>

<p class='c008'>When radio service to the eye shall have a comparable
development with radio service to the ear, a
new era will indeed have been ushered in, when
distance will no longer prevent our seeing our friend
as easily as we hear him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our President may then look on the face of the
King of England as he talks with him; or upon the
countenance of the President of France when exchanging
assurances of mutual esteem.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The general staff of our Navy and Army may see
at headquarters all that a lens looks upon as it is
carried aloft in a scouting airplane over battle front
or fleet maneuvers.</p>

<p class='c008'>And from our easy chairs by the fireside, we stay-at-homes
can watch the earth below as a great ship,
like the Shenandoah, carries our flag and a broadcasting
lens, over the mountains and plains, the
cities and farms, the lakes and forests, of our wonderful
country.</p>

<p class='c008'>In due course, then, folks in California and in
Maine, and all the way between, will be able to see
the inaugural ceremonies of their President, in
Washington; the Army and Navy football games at
Franklin Field, Philadelphia; and the struggle for
supremacy in our national sport, baseball.</p>

<p class='c008'>The new machine will come to the fireside as a
fascinating teacher and entertainer, without language,
literacy, or age limitation; a visitor to the old homestead
with photoplays, the opera, and a direct vision
of world activities, without the hindrance of muddy
roads or snow blockades, making farm life still more
attractive to the clever country-bred boys and girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>Already audible radio is rapidly changing our social
order; those who may now listen to a great man or
woman are numbered in the millions. Our President
recently talked to practically the whole citizenship
of the United States at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>When to this audible radio we add visible radio,
we may both hear and see great events; inaugural
ceremonies, a football, polo, or baseball game; a
regatta, mardi gras, flower festival, or baby parade;
and an entire opera in both action and music.</p>

<p class='c008'>Educationally, the extension worker in our great
universities may then illustrate his lecture, for the
distant student can see as well as hear him by radio.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>It is not a visionary, or even a very difficult thing
to do; speech and music are carried by radio, and
sight can just as easily be so carried.</p>

<p class='c008'>To get music by radio, a microphone converts
sound into electrical modulation, which, carried by
radio to distant places, is then changed back into
sound and we hear the music.</p>

<p class='c008'>To get pictures by radio, a sensitive cell converts
light into electrical current, and at radio distances
changes these currents back into light values, and
one may see the distant scene; for light is the thing
of which pictures are made, as music is made of
sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>To further show the close relation, it might be
added that in receiving sets these same electrical
values can be put back either into sound with headphones
or into light with a radio camera; although
it may be admitted that such radio signals do not
make much sense when with headphones one listens
to the pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>Already radio vision is a laboratory demonstration,
and while it is not yet finished and ready for general
public introduction, it soon will be, for it should be
borne in mind that animated pictures differ from
still pictures only in the speed of presentation, and
the sending of “still” pictures by radio is now an
accomplished fact, radio photographs of no mean
quality, examples of which appear as illustrations in
this volume.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as is done in radio photographs the picture
surface is traversed by a small spot of light moving
over the picture surface in successive parallel adjacent
lines, with the value of the lines changed by the
incoming radio signals to conform to a given order,
the order being controlled by the light values of the
scene at the distant sending station.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>In sending pictures electrically, there have been
but two methods employed, perhaps the only methods
possible; namely (<i>a</i>) a cylinder mechanism; and (<i>b</i>)
a flat surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without exception, every scheme which had
attained any degree of success, before the author
adopted flat surfaces, has depended upon synchronous
rotation of two cylinders, one at the sending station
with the picture thereon to be sent; and the other
at the receiving station where the picture is to be
put.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps the very obviousness of the cylinder
scheme, and that there are no patents to prevent,
explains why it has been employed by so many.
And there have been many workers in this line of
endeavor; for example, in England, Lord Northcliff,
Sir Thompson, Mr. Evans and Mr. Baker; in France,
MM. Armengaud, Ruhmer, Rignoux, Fournier, and
Belin; in Germany, Paul Nipkow, Dr. Anchutz, and
Dr. Korn.</p>

<p class='c008'>In America, Mr. Ballard, Mr. Brown, and Mr.
Amstutz, the latter deserving particular mention,
for, from a distant picture, a swelled gelatine print,
he engraved a printing plate which could be put
directly on a printing press for reproduction.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these many workers have adopted the cylinder
method of sending and receiving, and all have arrived
at approximately the final stage of development
permitted by concurrent science.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be well to explain that, in these older
schemes, the picture to be sent is wrapped around
the cylinder, usually a cylinder of glass where light
sensitive cells are employed, mounted on a rotating
shaft, which also has longitudinal displacement.</p>

<p class='c008'>The light values which make up the picture are
converted into electric current of corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>values and put upon a wire or other channel which
delivers them to the distant receiving station.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the receiving station a suitable film-like sheet
(paper, for example) is wrapped around a cylinder
similar to that at the sending station. As this
cylinder is rotated and longitudinally advanced
under a stationary point in contact with the paper
on the cylinder, a spiral is traced thereon. As the
incoming electrical current represents picture values,
and as the two cylinders are turning in exact synchronism,
a picture duplicate of that at the sending
station appears thereon. After the picture is completed
the paper sheet can then be taken off the
cylinder and flattened out for such use as may be
desired.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is quite obvious that vision by radio and radio
movies can never be attained by a cylinder method,
for as the picture must appear to the eye complete,
by reason of persistence of vision, it naturally
follows that the eye must make up the whole picture
from a single focal plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>The attainment of “television” or Radio Vision, as
it is now coming more commonly to be called, requires
that the sending shall be from a flat plane, and
reception on a flat plane, and a modulation which
will give not only the high-lights and shadows but the
halftones as well.</p>

<p class='c008'>These “flat planes” may, of course, be the focal
planes of the lenses employed at the receiving station,
and from the focal depth of the lens at the sending
station where the picture may perhaps be taken from
living actors in the studio or from an outdoor scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the receiving station the “flat surface” may be
a photographic plate, a white wall, or a miniature of
the usual “silver sheet” of the motion picture theatre.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may aid in a clearer and quicker understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of the text if the words telephone and television be
limited to metallic circuit service, while radio phone
and radio vision is applied to radio carried signals,
and this designation will be employed in the following
pages.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>INITIAL ACTIVITIES:</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The author’s work began with the publication in
the <cite>Motion Picture News</cite>, of October 4, 1913, of an
article entitled “Motion Pictures by Wireless.” This
contemplated the employment of a flat receiving
surface, but in the light of subsequent experience
the scheme proposed therein is believed to be impractical.
It did, however, provoke discussion of
the subject and initiated the work which was thereafter
rather continuously prosecuted, except for
interruption to aid in the great World War.</p>

<p class='c008'>After failure to find a practical, workable mechanism
made up of devices already in use in applied
science, diligent effort was made to discover the
necessary, missing part.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PRISMATIC RING:</h3>

<p class='c013'>At length a device described as a prismatic ring
was developed, a new contribution to optical science.
In use it is comparable to a solid glass prism which
changes the angle between its sides, giving to a beam
of light passing therethrough a hinged or oscillating
action on one side of the prism while maintaining a
fixed axis of the beam on the other side of the prism.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a convenience in fabrication this prismatic
ring is ground into the face of a glass disc of suitable
size, of selected mirror plate, which gives the ring
its own support on the rotating shaft upon which it
is mounted.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TRANSMITTING METHODS:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Success in sending pictures by radio from flat
photographs and receiving them on flat photo negative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>plates (and subsequently of radio vision),
really began with the perfection of automatic
machines for the making of these prismatic rings,
for by means of these prisms and a light sensitive cell
at the sending station the light values which make
up the picture are converted into electrical values,
and broadcast.</p>

<p class='c008'>So to put this picture on a radio carrier wave we
simply slice up the picture (figuratively) into slices
one-hundredth of an inch in width, in the best pictures,
by sweeping the picture across the light
sensitive cell by means of these rotating prismatic
rings. With each downward sweep the picture is
moved one-hundredth of an inch to the right until
the whole picture has crossed the cell, the cell converting
the light strengths of the different parts of
each such slice into corresponding electrical values.</p>

<p class='c008'>The process very much resembles a bacon slicer
in the market, each slice showing fat and lean.
Similarly these imaginary slices of our picture show
light and dark parts, and these lights and shadows
moving across the sensitive cell produce corresponding
strength of electric current, modulating the radio
carrier wave of the broadcasting set accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Further, of course, it is immaterial whether the
current modulation is taken directly from a flat
photograph, from a solid object, or from an outdoor
scene at which the transmitter is pointed.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RECEIVING METHODS:</h3>

<p class='c013'>To put these light values back together again at
the distant receiving station to make up a negative
of the picture being broadcast from the sending
station, it is only necessary to reverse the process;
first, with a point of light to draw lines across a
photographic plate, which the rotating prismatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>rings do; and, second, to vary the density of the
different parts of the successive lines corresponding
to lights and shadows of the picture at the sending
station, and this the varying strength of the incoming
radio signal does by varying the intensity of the
light.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dense areas in the negative are built up where the
light is successively very bright at the same place in
adjacent lines; halftones where the light is less
intense; while where the light is very faint, little or
no exposure occurs, and shadows will result.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is thus the lights and shadows which make the
picture are built up, line by line, for when this
negative is developed, and paper prints made therefrom,
the dense areas produce high-lights in the
picture; the less dense areas the halftones; and the
thin areas the shadows of the picture, person or
scene broadcast at the sending station. It is simply
that a photographic negative has been made of
what the lens at the sending station is looking at.</p>

<p class='c008'>So, then, to receive pictures by radio, it is only
necessary (1) to cover a photographic plate in
parallel adjacent lines, and (2) to vary the density
of the lines, to build up the shadows, the halftones,
and the high-lights of the picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>If one puts a nickel under a piece of paper and
draws <i>straight</i> lines across it with a dull pencil, a
picture of the Indian appears. And that is exactly
the way photographs by radio are received, except
that a photographic plate is used instead of a piece
of white paper, and a pencil of light instead of the
pencil of lead, the light pencil changing the exposure
in various parts of the successive adjacent parallel
lines by reason of the variation of the incoming radio
signals.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scheme is just a long camera with miles instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of inches between lens and plate. For example, the
lens in Washington and its photographic plate in
Boston; with this exception, that the one lens in
Washington can put a negative on one, ten or one
hundred photographic plates in as many different
cities at the same time, and at distances limited
only by the power of the broadcasting station, radio
instead of light carrying the image from lens to plate.</p>

<p class='c008'>The time for transmitting a picture depends upon
the size of the picture and strength of light, say,
from three to six minutes, using a filament lamp as a
source.</p>

<p class='c008'>The radio photograph receiving instruments are
rather simple and inexpensive and, like a loudspeaker,
can be attached to any standard amplifying audio-radio
receiving set.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FILAMENT LAMP:</h3>

<p class='c013'>For the light source for radio photographs a filament
lamp is employed, and in a single turn coil
enclosed in a hydrogen atmosphere. This miniature
filament coil is imaged on a photo negative plate,
and the variation in the light is caused by putting
the incoming radio signals through this lamp, perhaps
after the filament has been brought to a red
glow by a battery current. By adjusting the speed
of the motor to the temperature change of this
filament soft gradations of light and shade are
obtained which probably can never be equaled by
any other device, a photograph of true photographic
value, entirely free of lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author wishes to take this occasion to express
his appreciation of the splendid assistance of the
General Electric Company, under the personal
supervision and hearty cooperation of Mr. L. C.
Porter, who from the very first has shown his confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in the ultimate successful conclusion of this
development.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>GLOW LAMP:</h3>

<p class='c013'>For the high speed radio photograms, where only
blacks and whites are needed, a corona glow lamp of
very high frequency has been developed. This lamp
is lighted by the plate current of the last tube of the
amplifier; and as the lamp can be lighted and extinguished
a million times a second, it is obvious
that the permissible speed is almost limitless, and a
thousand words per minute is believed ultimately
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>This lamp has been developed for the author by
Professor D. McFarlan Moore, an expert in lamps
incorporating this phenomena, and who some years
ago, it may be remembered, produced a lamp of this
type more than two hundred feet long. It is probably
safe to predict that no other lamp will ever be
able to compete in speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>As photography is the quickest means of copying
anything; and radio the swiftest in travel, it seemed
logical that the two hitched together should constitute
the most rapid means of communication
possible.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CONTROL FORK:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of course, the sending machine and the receiving
machines must run in exact synchronism. This
synchronous control of the sending and receiving
motors is maintained by the vibration of a rather
heavy fork at each station, and adjusted to beat
together, with such slight automatic correction by
radio as may be required to keep all receiving forks
in step with the fork of the station which at the
moment is sending. It is a very simple and dependable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>mechanism, by which any number of motors, of
any size, separated by any distance, can be made to
run in synchronism.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RADIO MOTOR:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Another scheme of the rotary type, perhaps even
better adapted to the distant control of large motors,
is a small synchronous radio motor driven by power
carried by radio from the broadcasting station to the
receiving stations. It is, of course, rotated partly by
radio power from the distant station, and partly by
local current, just as a loudspeaker is operated.
These small motors, rotating in synchronism with
the motor at the sending station, control the rotation
of a larger motor in each receiving camera, and so all
stations keep in step.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>STROBOSCOPIC LAMP:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of course, it would be fatal if it were necessary to
wait until the picture was developed before it could
be discovered that the receiving camera was getting
out of control. So a special “neon” lamp is located
to shine on a revolving marker on the motor shaft
of the receiving instrument, and flashed by the incoming
radio signals, which latter bear a definite relation
to the rotation of the sending station motor.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SAME WAVE:</h3>

<p class='c013'>It should be noted that the same radio wave
carries both the picture frequency which builds up
the photograph and the synchronism frequency which
controls the motors, and also that it lights the
stroboscopic lamp.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MULTIPLE-SIGNAL RADIO:</h3>

<p class='c013'>A further advance step was made when an audible
message was added to the same radio wave which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>carried the picture. This is done by modulating
the carrier wave to give audibility, while interrupting
the same carrier wave at a frequency far above the
audible range, say, two hundred thousand cycles, to
make our picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>By means of this duplex employment of the same
radio wave, it is possible to get, for example, both
the gesture and the voice of an inaugural address;
the play and the cheers of a national sport; or the
acting and song of grand opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps it might be explained that synchronism
in visual-audible radio reception is accomplished by
the simple expedient of keeping the radio picture
“framed,” exactly as this is done in the motion
picture theatre.</p>

<p class='c008'>But continuing the description of the still picture
processes a little further, before taking up Radio
Vision and Radio Movies, it might be added that
while photographs by radio is the more interesting
and impressive process, there is little doubt but that
radio photo letters will be of much greater immediate
service in business.</p>

<p class='c008'>Commerce, like an army, can go forward no faster
than its means of communication. The history of
industrial advance in all ages shows that with every
addition to communication facilities the volume of
business has increased. Obviously a third electrical
means of communication will enlarge business, and
speed up commerce and industry.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an aid in national defense the chief of staff of the
Signal Corps of the Army, in a recently published
report to the Secretary of War, said (<cite>Washington
Star</cite>, November 22, 1924):</p>

<p class='c014'>“Looking into the future of signal communication
for a moment, it appears that the basic method of
breaking messages up into words, words into letters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>letters into dots-and-dashes, and then passing these
through the wrist of an operator, as has been the
practice since Morse’s fundamental invention of the
electric telegraph, seems to be nearing the end of a
cycle. Mechanical transmitters with higher speed
qualities are becoming stabilized and American
invention seems to be making further and rapid
progress in associating photography with radio,
which bids fair to revolutionize fundamental methods
of transmission.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The message of the future, whether it be written,
printed, of mixed with diagrams and photographs,
including the signature of the sender, will, it seems
certain, soon be transmitted photographically by
radio frequency at a rate tens of times faster than
was ever possible by the dot-and-dash methods of
hand transmission.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Military messages of the future, particularly in
active operations, may contain diagrams and
sketches, or even entire sheets of maps, all transmitted
as part of the same message and by means
of which detection or listening-in will be reduced to
a very low minimum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The author suggests that it might be added that
the newcomer, the radio photogram, has merits
distinctly its own, e. g.:</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) It is autographically authentic; (2) it is photographically
accurate; (3) it is potentially very rapid;
(4) it is little effected by static; (5) it is not effected
by storms; and (6) it is automatic and tireless.</p>

<p class='c008'>It can also be used to enlarge the individual newspaper’s
influence and prestige by the establishment of
photostat branch printing plants at strategic points,
like summer camps, and winter resorts, and at
ridiculously little cost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such copies of the news, financial and market
report pages of the paper could be distributed in
these distant places before they could possibly
appear on the streets of the home city of the paper.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Of course, produce market reports, stock market
news, and similar matter could be so distributed very
much quicker than could be done by any other
system, certainly so to the farmer and gardener.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RADIO VISION:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Radio Photographs and Radio Vision, when both
are done by the flat-plate method, are identical in
principle, the difference being only in the speed of
the apparatus, with such modification in the apparatus
as will permit of the required speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as in the Radio Photograph the picture surface
of the Radio Vision is covered with a small spot of
light moving over the picture surface in successive
parallel lines, with the light value of the lines changed
by the incoming radio signals to conform to a given
order, the order being controlled by the distant
scene at the sending station.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as the whole picture surface is covered in
one-twelfth to one-sixteenth of a second, persistence
of vision of the human eye is sufficient to get the
picture from the white receiving screen—a photographic
plate is not necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the machine of Radio Vision is turned over
slowly, the little spot of light on the screen which
makes up the picture looks for all the world like a
tiny, twinkling star as it travels across the white
surface of the screen in adjacent parallel lines, changing
in light value to correspond in position and intensity
to the light values of the scene before the lens
at the broadcasting station.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the machine is speeded up until the succession
of lines recur with a frequency which deceives
the eye into the belief that it sees <i>all</i> these lines <i>all</i>
the time, then a picture suddenly flashes out on the
white screen in all the glory of its pantomime mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>To accomplish this, the apparatus must be speeded
up until a whole picture can be assembled on the
screen, say, in one-sixteenth of a second, to be seen
by the eye directly.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was necessary to modify the Radio Photo
apparatus to permit this increase in speed. So a
lens disc is substituted for the fast pair of prismatic
plates. Each lens draws a line while the relatively
slow rotation of the prismatic plates distributes the
lines over the whole picture surface, just exactly as
the plates do in the Radio Photo Camera.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Radio Vision receiving set and the Radio
Movies set are identical, and one may, therefore,
see in one’s home what is happening in a distant
place, an inaugural parade, football, baseball, or
polo game (and we call it Radio Vision); or one may
see the motion picture taken from the screen of a
distant theatre (and we call it Radio Movies).</p>

<p class='c008'>The Radio Vision receiving set, as now designed,
is very simple; namely, a mahogany box, or small
lidded cabinet, containing, beside the radio receiving
set and a loudspeaker, only a small motor rotating a
pair of glass discs, and a miniature, high frequency
lamp for outlining the pantomime picture on a small
motion picture screen in the raised lid of the cabinet,
synchronism being maintained by the simple expedient
of “framing” the picture on the screen exactly
as this is done in a moving picture theatre.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness
to his friend, Professor D. McFarlan Moore,
for a word name for this new device, i.e., “telorama”
for the radio vision instrument, and “teloramaphone”
for the instrument when it includes simultaneous
reproduction of the music or sound accompanying
the living scene.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>RADIO SERVICE TO THE EYE:</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Since the initiation of broadcasting, a veritable
army of engineers have been devoting themselves to
the development of radio as a service to the ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author for several years has been, rather
lonesomely, devoting his efforts to the development
of radio as a service to the eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>Incidentally it is suggested that there are undreamed
of possibilities in radio in the unlimited
frequencies above audibility, in which speed transmission
is greatly accelerated by the tolerance of
eyesight, not possible in an appeal to the ear. Witness,
the motion picture theatre screen upon which a
picture is taken off and put back again forty-eight
times per second without discovery by the eye; while
the slightest error in a note in the orchestra is
detected at once and grates harshly on the ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as the motion picture depends for success on
the fact that the eye is easily deceived, so in Radio
Vision the eye is fooled into the belief that it sees the
radio picture as a whole, though in fact the eye sees
at any one moment only the tiny spot of light by
which, with almost lightning like speed, the picture
is made up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Audio radio engineers have been working in the
very limited audio-frequency band below, say, ten
thousand cycles, whereas the workable range where
light instead of sound is employed goes away up to
millions of cycles. It is confidently predicted that
the next great development in radio is in this area.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the “teloramaphone” is made generally
available, then pictures at the fireside sent from
distant world points will be the daily source of news;
the daily instructional class; and the evening’s
entertainment; and equally the long day of the sick
and shut-ins will be more endurable, and life in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>far places less lonely, for the flight of radio is not
hindered by rain, or storm, or snow blockades.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MECHANISMS EMPLOYED:</h3>

<p class='c013'>The successful study of the problem of the transmission
of light effects electrically (vision, pictures,
light signals, etc.) might well begin with the division
of the subject into its elements and sub-elements.</p>

<p class='c008'>The major division is, naturally, into (<i>a</i>) the
sending station apparatus; and (<i>b</i>) the receiving
station apparatus. A great variety of devices have
been invented for analysis of the picture at the
sending station, and the translation of the light values
(which make up the picture) into electrical modulation;
and likewise a variety of methods for receiving
these electrical signals at a distant place (or places)
and there changing the electrical modulations back
into light values with which the picture is built up.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SENDING MACHINES—ZINC ETCHING:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Before the refinement of light sensitive cells, actual
electrical contact was oftenest employed in sending
the impulses which represented light gradations in
the picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Usually, therefore, a zinc etching of a pen and ink
picture was made, and curved into a cylinder. This
picture cylinder was then slipped onto a rotating
mandril, which was also moved axially by a screw
thread on the mandril shaft; or the cylinder rotated
and a contact arm moved along by the screw, like
the old wax cylinder phonograph.</p>

<p class='c008'>A delicately suspended arm, moved along by the
screw as just described and carrying, instead of the
phonograph sound box, a very small and smooth
point which was lifted by the high parts of the zinc
etched picture. When so lifted the arm makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>electrical contact with an adjustable point and
current is put into the inter-station wire circuit.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this means the values of the picture are converted
into corresponding duration values of an
electric current, and put onto a wire connecting the
sending machine with a distant receiving machine
(described in detail later in the text).</p>

<p class='c008'>It will thus be seen that the electric impulses sent
out over a wire attached to the contact point represent
the value of the light and dark portions of the
picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The electric impulses are similar to letter-code
dots-and-dashes, for the picture actually opens and
closes the circuit, like a telegraph key, the dark
portions of the picture sending dashes and the light
portions of the picture sending dots. With the
point set at one end of the cylinder, and the contact
arm advancing longitudinally by reason of the thread
on the shaft, the point traverses a spiral around the
cylinder until the whole picture is covered.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SWELLED GELATINE PRINT:</h3>

<p class='c013'>In another process a swelled gelatine picture print
was used to raise and lower the contact-making arm,
and a carbon contact button was employed, but
otherwise the sending machine was much the same.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FILLED-IN HALFTONES:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Somewhat later halftones of photos were available,
and these were similarly bent into cylinders. The
interstices between the metal points of the halftones
were filled with an insulating wax, and the whole
smoothed off until the bright metal points (of different
size and representing the different values of the
picture) were exposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this picture cylinder was rotated under a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>contact point, the cylinder and the point being
parts of an electric circuit, current flowed in the
circuit whenever the point touched the metal parts
of the picture, but no current flowed when the
insulation passed under the point.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because the point does not jump up and down,
but has a smooth surface to ride on, greater speed
and accuracy is possible with the filled-in etching.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LIGHT SENSITIVE CELLS:</h3>

<p class='c013'>As is quite generally known there are certain
“semi-metals” which have the property of changing
their resistence to an electric current when light falls
thereon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of this group selenium is typical, although there
are several others, thallium, strontium, barium, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>More recently it was discovered that some of the
rarer alkali metals had the property, under certain
conditions, of actually converting light into electric
current. In this group are potassium, sodium,
caesium, rubidium, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>These light sensitive cells vary the electric current
quite accurately in proportion to the intensity of
the light falling thereon, and when available were
quickly seized upon by the workers in “pictures-by-electricity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When these light sensitive cells were employed,
a modification of the previous picture-translating
methods and mechanisms was made, for now a
modulation instead of an interruption of the electric
current was possible, the modulation representing
the values of the halftones of a picture transparency
as well as its blacks and whites.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rotating cylinder now employed was of glass,
around which the picture, on transparent film, was
wrapped. Inside the cylinder a light was put to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>shine through the passing picture film as a minute
point of light falling on the light sensitive cell
located in a dark box.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as in the other cylinder schemes the picture
is made to traverse this point of light until the whole
picture is converted into electric current of corresponding
values, which, as before, can be put on
a wire, or can be made to modulate a radio wave.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PERFORATED PAPER STRIPS:</h3>

<p class='c013'>One of the oddities of picture analytical translation
consists of running a perforated paper strip between
a source of light and a light sensitive cell, the paper
ribbon perforated with a series of groups of holes.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is intended that the number of holes in successive
groups along the ribbon shall represent successive
values of light in the different parts of the picture
to be transmitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>While it is possible to perforate such a ribbon it is
quite likely that the experienced engineer would
adopt some of the simpler forms of picture translation,
for there are enough of them which may be
used without hesitation, such basic patents as have
ever existed having long since expired.</p>

<p class='c008'>An unusual scheme consists in writing the message
in ink made of saltpeter, and then setting fire to the
ink line. The ink line of the message burns itself
out leaving the paper intact. Thereupon the paper
is carefully laid on the metal cylinder of the sending
machine, or on “silver paper” which is put on the
sending cylinder. The contact point drops through
the burnt lines making contact, and the out-going
signals, received on a like cylinder at a distant
station, make a duplicate of the original message.</p>

<p class='c008'>A more satisfactory scheme is to put a thin coating
of hard wax on a thin sheet of metal, or metal coated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>papers. These sheets as wanted are laid on an
electric hot-plate and the message, picture, or sketch,
is written through the warm wax coating with a lead
pencil or stylus. Then the paper with its message
etched therein, is wrapped around the sending
cylinder and rotated under the contact-making
finger, which sends out the electrical impulses.</p>

<p class='c008'>One may also take the sketch, line drawing, or
pen picture, to the zinc etcher (halftone engraving
plant), and have him make a print on very thin
metal, and develop and harden it, but not etch it.
This will give a photographically accurate copy.
This copy on the metal sheet can then be bent around
the cylinder of your sending machine, and sent out
by wire or radio, to be received at all stations tuned
in. If etched the etching may be filled in with hard
wax and this put on the cylinder, and run under the
contact finger.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is possible to write on paper with copper sulphate
(blue vitral) solution, for the acidulated line
carries the current through the paper to the metal
cylinder beneath, and completes the circuit. The
acid may even be strong enough to eat through the
paper exposing the metal cylinder underneath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salt water with a little glycerine to keep it from
drying up too fast will also perform.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another method which has been proposed is to
print or write on paper with sticky material, like
Japan drier, and sprinkle thereon a fine powdered
wax, battery sealing wax, for example. This will
stick to the tacky lines and can be melted over a
hot plate or in an oven. The melted wax leaves
standing lines which will raise a contact-closing pen
passing over it. If the lines are sprinkled with
metallic powder a double contact pen can be used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and the mechanism is still simpler, less delicate, and
more dependable.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the newer methods of photogram transmission
is to use a rotating table, like a talking machine
table, with a rectangular piece of paper thereon
(tucked under at the corners), from which to send a
communication; market bulletins, for example, broadcast
by a progressive newspaper to the farmers and
truck gardener patrons in their vicinity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The contact point is advanced from the outer edge
to the centre by a spiral cut on the under side of the
table; or by a threaded edge of a detachable tabletop
and a reducing gear to move the contact arm
across the message, or other scheme.</p>

<p class='c008'>(Of course, the receiving machine should be a
duplicate of the sending machine, with suitable
receiving surface.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The bulletin sheet can not be advantageously used
to the very centre, any more than a music record
can, but this space can be employed by the broadcaster
for printed announcements (as music disc records
are so used), the receiving paper being furnished
by the broadcaster.</p>

<p class='c008'>But of all the schemes it is very doubtful if any
will ever equal the writing of the message or sketch
in lead pencil on paper, and rotate it under a two-contact
collector. The graphite of the lines makes
contact across the twin-blade terminals, effecting
the transmitter as would a telegraph key in the
circuit.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RECEIVING MACHINES:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Coming now to the design of a suitable receiving
machine, it will be found that an even greater variety
of schemes have been tried.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>INK PEN RECEIVERS:</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Upon a rotating and longitudinally moving cylinder,
similar to that of the sending machine first
described, a paper is put, and upon this paper, as
the cylinder rotates, an ink pen, mounted on a pivoted
arm, touches intermittently, being drawn down to
ink the paper with every incoming electrical impulse,
and lifted off the paper by a gentle spring.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CAPILLARY PEN:</h3>

<p class='c013'>In another ink and pen scheme the electric current
is passed through a capillary ink tube to make it
flow and black the paper; no lifting of the pen arm
is necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the order of these dots-and-dashes is controlled
by the impulses put into the line by the picture at
the sending station, a picture is built up on the
paper on the receiving machine cylinder, a copy of
the picture on the cylinder of the sending machine.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ELECTROLYTIC RECEIVERS:</h3>

<p class='c013'>In another and similar scheme a chemically
treated paper is put on the cylinder, and upon this,
as it rotates, a metallic point is gently pressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the incoming electric current from the sending
station passes through the paper under the contact
point an electrolysis occurs which appears as a
discoloration of the paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as these discolored dots-and-dashes appear,
as before, in an order controlled by the distant
station, a picture is again built up on the paper, a
copy of the picture at the sending station.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the best solutions for the purpose is made
up of Iodide of Potassium one-half pound; Bromide
of Potassium two pounds; Dextrine or Starch one
ounce; and Distilled Water one gallon. (Use an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>iron contact needle). There are other solutions
made of Ferricyanide, but are not so satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still another scheme, the simplest of mechanisms,
consists of a metal disc upon which electrolytic paper
is clipped. This plate is then put on the rotating
table of a talking machine. A rubbing electrical
contact is made with the disc, and the other wire
attached to the tone arm to complete the circuit
through the steel needle of the sound box.</p>

<p class='c008'>As no groove is available to carry the arm toward
the centre of the disc, a spurred-wheel is attached
thereto, so as to engage the paper on the disc. The
wheel can be adjusted diagonally of the tone arm to
give any separation required in the convolutions of
the spiral line.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the schemes employed, and with considerable
success for its time, consisted of an engraving
tool, moved up and down radially of a coated cylinder,
cutting a groove of varying width in the soft
coating of the cylinder.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this coating was stripped off the cylinder,
laid out flat and hardened, it was mounted on a
printing block, inked, and impressions taken therefrom
on a suitable printing press.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PHOTOGRAPHIC RECEIVERS:</h3>

<p class='c013'>But doubtless photographic paper, wrapped around
the cylinder, has been used oftener than any other
medium. With photo paper or film a point of light
is usually employed to expose the film.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>OSCILLOGRAPH RECEIVERS:</h3>

<p class='c013'>The point sources of light used and methods of
modulation have been almost as varied as the
temperaments of the several workers. One of the
first was the employment of a steady light source
which, reflected in the tiny mirror of an oscillograph,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>is caused to vibrate at a high frequency across a
minute aperture which in turn is imaged on the
film on the cylinder. As the amplitude of vibration
of the mirror determines the amount of light passing
through the aperture and falling on the film, it will
readily be understood that the strength of the
incoming electric signals, representing light values
of the picture at the distant station, reproduce
duplicate values on the exposed film. When this
film is developed a copy of the picture on the cylinder
of the sending machine is obtained.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LIGHT WEDGE MODULATION:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Another scheme for modulating the light falling
on the film on the cylinder, consists in placing a
light wedge against the face of a lens which images the
vibrating mirror (or light source) on the film.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the light is constantly imaged on the film by
the lens its slight displacement toward the dark end
of the light wedge by the vibration of the mirror
decreases the strength of the light falling on the
film, while displacement toward the thin edge of the
light wedge gives greater exposure on the film.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is obvious, therefore, that the vibration of the
mirror determines the exposure at successive positions
on the film; and as these displacements follow
the varying strength of the incoming electric current,
and the latter in turn is determined by the light
values of the picture at the sending station, it naturally
follows that when the film is developed a duplicate
of the distant picture results.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SILVER WIRE GALVANOMETER:</h3>

<p class='c013'>Another method of varying the light falling on
the photo film on the cylinder consists in mounting
two very minute overlapping shutters one on each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of the two wires of an electric circuit suspended in a
strong magnetic field. On these overlapping shutters
a light source is focused, so that greater or lesser
displacement of the shutters, by reason of varying
strengths of current in the adjacent runs of the wire,
allows more or less light to pass there between.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another lens images these tiny shutters onto the
film covered cylinder, so that when the shutters are
opened by the incoming currents in the two wires, the
light is concentrated on the film.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the exposure depends on (<i>a</i>) the shutter openings,
and the shutter opening on (<i>b</i>) the incoming
current strength, and the incoming current strength
on (<i>c</i>) the light values at the sending station, development
of the film again gives a duplicate of the
picture at the sending station.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PNEUMATIC VALVE:</h3>

<p class='c013'>An interesting scheme of picture reception is
known as the pneumatic light valve, the vibration of
which causes a shadow band to oscillate across a
lens opening into the camera.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a circular center opening in a magnetized iron
diaphragm is suspended an iron disc somewhat
smaller than the opening. This small disc is magnetically
held by its edge to the inside edge of the
opening in the diaphragm, with its plane in the plane
of the magnetic field of the diaphragm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon the disc is mounted a tiny mirror, and as the
suspension of the disc is in the magnetic field held
there by the strength of the field itself, it is extremely
easily disturbed, so that a small beam of light
reflected from the mirror can be vibrated with a very
little current through great amplitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the beam of light has a transverse shadow
band therein of a width to normally close the lens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>opening into the camera, the varying amplification
of the vibration of the mirror, and therefore, of the
shadow, admits a proportional amount of light.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SPARK GAP:</h3>

<p class='c013'>One of the very simplest light sources for exposing
the film on the receiving cylinder consists of a
minute spark-gap located in contact with the moving
film.</p>

<p class='c008'>The strength of the incoming current charges a
small condenser until the gap breaks down and the
passing spark exposes the film (or perhaps perforates
it). If the current is strong the sparks pass the gap
at a high frequency, while if the current is weak the
frequency is less. The range may be from 500 to
5,000 per second perhaps, depending on the current
strength, and, of course, the film exposure correspondingly
varies, and the different degrees of density
of the picture results.</p>

<p class='c008'>This scheme requires about as small current as is
likely to be practical, perhaps, especially when the
spark is in a suitable degree of vacuum, and, of
course, the incoming radio signals require correspondingly
small amplification.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FILAMENT LAMP:</h3>

<p class='c013'>The direct source of light which in the author’s
laboratory has produced the most perfect photographic
effects, i. e., photographs absolutely without
lines, consists of a lamp about an inch in diameter
and two inches long, fitted with a standard screw
base. The tube contains a .6 mil filament with a
small single turn coil in a hydrogen atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>The coil is offset until it almost touches the glass
wall. Such location of the coiled filament permits
the effective placing of a minute aperture in very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>close relation to the filament; whereas an aperture
on the outside of a bulb with the light source in the
centre of the bulb acts like a pin-hole camera, and
sharpness of image is practically impossible (unless
a lens is used).</p>

<p class='c008'>The lamp described above will respond to fluctuations
in current well above a thousand times per
second, but requires voltages about four times
normal. It was made for the author by courtesy
of the General Electric Company, under the direction
of Mr. L. C. Porter, of Harrison, N. J.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CORONA LAMP:</h3>

<p class='c013'>But the lamp that really elicits the author’s
unqualified admiration is the corona glow lamp made
for the author by Professor D. McFarlan Moore.
It consists of a small glass bulb containing a neat-fitting
metallic cylinder, one terminal of an attached
circuit. Inside and concentric with the cylinder is
a second cylindrical capsule made of a solid rod
drilled to a predetermined depth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The electron stream from the outside cylinder to
the capsule naturally takes the long path, and as the
longest path is down into the capsule, the result is
that the small central opening of the capsule glows
with great intensity while the other parts of the
lamp remain dark. This lamp, Professor Moore
advises, has a light and dark frequency of a million
per second.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>The First Radio Channel</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While perhaps not singly applicable to the subject
of pictures by radio, it is certain that without the
discovery that signals could be transmitted through
the air without wires, we should not now have either
audible or visual radio.</p>

<p class='c008'>While in 1832 Professor Joseph Henry discovered
that electrical oscillations could be detected a considerable
distance from the oscillator, it remained
for a dentist, Dr. Mahlon Loomis, of Washington,
D. C., to actually send the first radio messages. In
1865 he built an oscillating circuit, and connected
it to a wire aerial supported in the air by a kite.
One station was set up on the top of Bear Den
Mountain, in Virginia, not very far from Washington;
a duplicate station being set up on top of Catoctin
Spur, some fifteen miles distant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Messages were sent alternately from one station
to the other station, by dot-and-dash interruption of
a buzzer spark circuit; while reception was attained
by deflecting a galvanometer needle at the station
which was at the moment receiving.</p>

<p class='c008'>In <cite>Leslie’s Weekly</cite> (1868) Frank Leslie personally
describes these “successful experiments in communication
without the aid of wires.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Later (1869) a bill was introduced in the U. S.
Congress to incorporate the Loomis Aerial Telegraph
Company (though nobody would buy the
stock, and it remained for others, years later, to
reap the reward of radio broadcasting).</p>

<p class='c008'>In speaking on the bill, Senator Conger repeated,
he said, the explanation that Dr. Loomis made to
him, that—</p>

<p>This Illustration of Dr. Mahlon Loomis’s Wireless Telegraph Set Was Made from His Original Drawings of His Invention Which Are on File in the United States Patent Office at Washington.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“The system consists of causing electrical vibrations,
or waves (from the kite wire aerial) to pass
around the world, as upon the surface of some quiet
lake into which a stone is cast one wave circlet follows
another from the point of disturbance to the
remotest shores; so that from any other mountain top
upon the globe another conductor which shall receive
the impressed vibrations may be connected to
an inductor which will mark the duration of such
vibration, and indicate by an agreed system of notation,
convertible into human language, the message
of the operator at the point of first disturbance.”—<i>From
Congressional Globe, Library of Congress.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps it may be a coincidence, or perhaps a blood
strain of the pioneer, that the first radio school ever
set up by a woman should have been founded by
his granddaughter, Miss Mary Texanna Loomis,
Washington, D. C.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Nipkow and Sutton</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the most interesting examples of the attempts
to see by radio was made the subject of a
patent by Nipkow in 1884. The proposed transmitter
consisted of a selenium cell and an objective
lens, with a spirally perforated disc rotating between
the cell and lens “to dissect the scene.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The receiving device employed the polarizing light
valve used by Major George O. Squire, and Professor
A. C. Crehore, to measure the flight of gun shells
at Fort Monroe, Virginia, in 1895.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Nipkow scheme was preceded by Shelford
Bidwell’s device for “the telegraphic transmission
of pictures of natural objects,” described in <cite>Telegraphic
Journal</cite> 1881, Vol. 9, page 83; and later
almost exactly duplicated by M. Henri Sutton, and
rather fully described in <cite>Lumiere Electrique</cite>, Vol. 38,

<p class='c007'>Of all the mechanisms which have been designed
for the transmission of pictures electrically, that of
N. S. Amstutz, of Valparaiso, Indiana, U. S. A., in
the author’s opinion, stands out as the most conspicuous,
not only for fine work, but for the cleverness
of its accomplishment, the first successful picture
being sent in May, 1891, over a 25-mile wire in
eight minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Amstutz was not the first to send pictures
over wire, but he was the first to send pictures with
halftones, the others were simply line drawings. In
this first method Mr. Amstutz used a relief photograph.
The amount of relief was in direct proportion
to the amount of light which had acted on the
sensitive gelatine, resulting in an irregular surface,
representing in elevation all the variations of light
and shade in a regular picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The picture received is actually a phonographic
spiral around the receiving drum carrying the
celluloid sheet. When finished it is removed from
the cylinder and flattened out and a stereotype or
electrotype made from it for relief printing; or the
engraved celluloid sheet can be inked and printed
immediately on the intaglio press.” (<i>From exhibit in
U. S. National Museum.</i>)</p>

<p class='c007'>From the accompanying illustration and title it
will readily be seen that rather good pictures were
reproduced with pen and ink method in 1890.</p>

<p class='c008'>The original of this picture was given the author by
Mr. T. A. Witherspoon, who at the time of the
experiment (1900) was a principal examiner in the
U. S. Patent Office, and detailed in charge of the
Patent Office Exhibit at the Buffalo Exposition,
where, also, these machines were on exhibition.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>The Baker Machine</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The machine of the opposite illustration, “the
telestereograph,” is the invention of T. Thorn Baker,
Esq., of England, and “was used by the <cite>London
Daily Mirror</cite> in July, 1909, and was worked by wire
rather regularly between London and Paris, and
London and Manchester.” The picture to be sent
was “a halftone photograph printed in fish glue on
lead foil, and wrapped on a sending cylinder, rotating
once every two seconds with a metal point riding on
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The receiving cylinder carried “an absorbent
paper impregnated with a colorless solution which
turns black or brown when decomposed by the incoming
electric current.”</p>

<p class='c008'>What electrolytic solution was employed is not
stated in the report, but was probably sodium iodide
or potassium bromide judging from the description
of its color and behavior.</p>

<p class='c008'>To synchronize, the receiving drum turns faster
than the sending drum, and is caught each revolution
until the other catches up. (<cite>Smithsonian Report</cite>,

  <h2 class='c006'>The Dr. Korn Machine</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The accompanying illustration shows the work of
a machine developed by Dr. Korn, of Germany, and
first used by the Daily Mirror between London and
Paris in 1907. “On a revolving glass cylinder” a
transparent picture was put. He used a Nernst
lamp and “selenium cells on opposite sides of a
Wheatstone bridge” to overcome the inherent lag of
the selenium cell.</p>

<p class='c008'>Signals were sent over a wire and received on
photographic film on a cylinder, using “two fine
silver strings free to move laterally in a strong
magnetic field.” A light was focused on the obstructing
“silver strings,” which the incoming electric
signals, passing through the “strings,” separated to
a greater or lesser degree “to widen or thin the
photographed line.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the film is developed it is laid out flat, and
the spiral line becomes resolved into so many parallel
lines.” The sending and the receiving machines
were synchronized by “well calibrated clocks which
released the cylinders at end of every five seconds.”
(<i>Mr. Baker in Smithsonian Report</i>, 1910.)</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Rignoux and Fournier Scheme</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the early suggestions had for its fundamental
principle a surface studded with thousands of
“selenium cells” each a part of an individual circuit,
and upon which a picture was projected. The idea
was that the different cells would transmit a different
value of current with each different intensity of
light which made up the picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the distant station a given surface had a corresponding
number of tiny lamps, each attached to
its respective cell at the sending station, and being
lighted thereby the ensemble would reproduce the
distant picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scheme is possible but hardly practical, for if
only fifty lines per inch each way were sufficient on
a picture but one foot square, there would have to
be three hundred and sixty thousand cells at the
sending end, and a like number of lamps at the receiving
end, each but one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter.
Such a problem would seem to present difficulties,
though the author himself in the bravery of
ignorance suggested this very scheme in the <cite>Electrical
Engineer</cite>, of July 25, 1894. (<i>Illustration by courtesy

  <h2 class='c006'>The Belin Machine</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The “Belinograph” is the invention of Edouard
Belin, of Paris. With these machines “the first step
in transmitting a picture is to convert the latter into
a bas-relief. Or a drawing can be made in a special
ink, which, when dry, leaves the lines in relief. The
picture when ready for transmission has an uneven
surface, the irregularities of which correspond with
the pictorial details. The transmitter resembles the
cylinder of a phonograph. The picture is wrapped
around this metal cylinder, and a style presses down
on the picture cylinder as it is rotated by clockwork.
As the style moves up and down over the irregularities
of the picture, a microphone varies the strength of an
electric transmitting current.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At the receiving end another cylinder in a light-tight
box carries a sensitized paper upon which a
point of light is reflected from the mirror of a galvanometer
actuated by the incoming current from
the distant station.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Two very accurately regulated chronometers are
employed to keep the machines in synchronism, one
chronometer for the sending machine and one for
the distant receiving machine. (<i>From Review of
Reviews</i>, 1922.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The picture opposite is one of those sent by the
A. T. &#38; T. Company on May 20, 1924, by wire from
Cleveland to New York. Some of the pictures sent
were from photographs taken earlier, and some were
taken only a few minutes before being transmitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sending machine, “the film picture is inserted
in the machine simply by rolling it up in a cylindrical
form and slipped into the drum. During operation
a very small and intense beam of light shines through
the film upon a photo-electric cell within.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the receiving machine, “the sensitive film is
put on a rotating cylinder and turns like the cylinder
record on a phonograph. On this film falls a point
of intense white light varied constantly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For synchronizing “two separate currents were
sent over the wires, one is called the picture channel,
the other the synchronizing channel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forty-four minutes elapsed from the time the
picture was taken in Cleveland until it was reproduced
in New York.” (<cite>New York Times, May
20, 1924.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems unlikely that returns from the daily wire
transmission of pictures can equal the day-by-day
revenue from the wires used for the transmission of
speech when balanced up for the principal circuit,
phantom circuits, and carrier circuits.</p>

<p class='c007'>The accompanying “photoradiogram” is a development
by the Radio Corporation of America, and was
transmitted from London to New York on November
30, 1924.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The transparent picture film is placed on a glass
cylinder. An incandescent lamp inside the cylinder
is focused in a minute beam onto the film as the
cylinder rotates, and this transfers the light values
of the picture into electrical impulses, in a General
Electric Company photo-electric cell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The receiving cylinder has white paper placed
thereon, and the incoming dots-and-dashes, amplified
in passing through a bank of vacuum tubes, are
recorded in ink on this paper with a special vibrating
fountain pen, drawn down by magnet coils to record
the picture much in the style of an artistic stippled
engraving.” The cylinders of both the sending and
the receiving machines are “rotated back and forth,
the electric camera itself advancing down the length
of the picture one notch at a time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The necessary synchronism of the two machines
is maintained by the use of special driving motors,
and a special controlling mechanism based on the
constant pitch of a tuning fork.” (<i>See Radio News,
February, 1925.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'>The above is an example of one of the rather odd
methods of “sending pictures by radio.” The picture
to be sent is divided into many small squares
with varying values of dark in the squares. Seventeen
different grades of light in these squares are
translated into seventeen letters printed on a tape.</p>

<p class='c008'>This coded picture is transmitted to a distant
place and there decoded into dots of sizes corresponding
to the seventeen values, and each dot placed in
its corresponding square on a white paper. The
collection of large dots builds up the dark areas; a
similar collection of smaller dots makes up the halftones;
and still other collections of very minute
dots make up the light areas. (<i>From the New York

<p class='c008'>This coded information is telegraphed to the distant

the light values to be washed in on paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>The process depends for its success largely on the

hardly more than a “filler-in” pending the adaption

  <h2 class='c006'>The Braun Tube Receiver</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One of the theoretically attractive forms of
receivers is the Braun oscillograph tube, for it is so
very easy to wobble the cathode ray spot about over
the fluorescent screen, to form figures. It has an
imponderable pencil of light which can be moved
over the picture screen with very little electrical
energy. Its use has been proposed by many.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the feature of the system which is most often
overlooked in this scheme is the necessity for an
analytical picture machine at the sending station,
and no such device in satisfactory workable form has
yet been suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Braun tube system awaits, therefore, the
attention of the practical-application engineer before
it can compete with other forms of receivers.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Pictures by Radio in Natural Colors</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is well known that pictures in color are in common
use in magazine printing, in window transparencies,
decorations, etc. The process consisting in making
three negatives, one through a red screen, a second
through a green screen, and a third through a blue
screen. When transparencies from these three negatives,
each stained in its complementary color, red,
green and blue, are superimposed and viewed by
transmitted light, the resultant picture is seen in its
natural colors.</p>

<p class='c008'>With this process generally well known, it is
obvious that three such negatives transmitted by
radio or wire could be colored and combined to make
a “picture sent by radio in natural colors.” Of
course, the picture is not sent in color at all, and the
author hesitates to claim for such a feat more than
that the resultant picture proves the excellence of the
synchronism of the machines employed in the transmission
of the three successive pictures which after
their reception are to be colored and combined
into one.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Prismatic Disc Machines</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These machines are principally used in radio
transmission of photographs; employ four overlapping
prismatic discs or “rings” in both the sending and
the receiving machines. Either a transparent or an
opaque picture is used in the sending instrument;
and in the receiving camera a filament lamp, modulated
by the incoming radio signals, recorded on a
photographic negative plate.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sending machine (first illustration) the
picture is projected with a magic lantern (1) through
four overlapping prismatic rings, (2) two of which in
rotation sweep the picture vertically across the light
sensitive cell, at the same time the image is moved
laterally by the other pair of prisms. The different
light values of the picture are changed into electric
values in light cell 4, and broadcast. A rotating
perforated disc, (3) interposed between the lens and
light cell, produces a pulsating direct current which
can immediately be amplified through the usual radio
transformers, on its way to the broadcasting set.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the radio camera (second illustration) a photographic
negative (1) is used and a pencil of light
from lamp 2. The rotating plates (3) draw the
lines and the radio signals vary the light intensities
of the lamp to give gradations of exposure on the
negative plate. (See next page.)</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>The Jenkins Prismatic Ring</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The prismatic ring or plate is a new contribution
to optical science, and was designed for use in a
machine for the transmission of radio pictures from
a flat surface, and for recording them on a flat surface,
the only way in which radio vision and radio movies
will ever be produced; and a method which permits
of the reception of portraits having true photographic
value, without lines, and having tone and shading
unequaled by any other known process to date.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prismatic ring section is ground into the face
of a glass disc, and from one end to a point half
around it has its base outward, and from this midway
point around to the other end having its base inward.
The warp from one end to the other is gradual.</p>

<p class='c008'>A beam of light passing through this ring, in rotation,
is caused to oscillate, having its hinged action
fulcrumed in the plane of rotation of the prism ring.
The oscillation is always in the plane of the diameter
of the disc from the point where the light passes
through the prismatic ring section.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plates (made with the initial grinding machine)
may have one, two, or four prismatic sections to the
ring, and may be made right or left hand, and in 10
inch and in 7 inch sizes, and also in disc ring (first
illustration) or band ring form (second illustration).</p>

<p class='c007'>The accompanying photographs show a vibrating-fork-control
employed to keep distantly separated
motors in synchronism. This is the motor control
employed in the system developed by the author for
the sending and receiving of photographs and
photograms, by radio and by wire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The control unit is surprisingly simple and dependable,
and is believed might be found useful for many
other purposes where it is desired to keep motors in
step with each other which are separated by long
distances, the control signals being sent by wire or
by radio, and from fixed or moveable stations, on
land, on water, or in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fork illustrated is about fifteen inches long,
mounted on a cast brass frame with a bakelite cover
plate upon which the fork, motor coil, and binding
posts are mounted. A single cell of dry battery
keeps the fork in vibration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The device is designed on a new principle, and
has a very sharp control of the motor revolutions.
Simple means are provided for easily verifying the
continuity of the motor control.</p>

<p class='c008'>These fork motor units will control any number
of motors of any size, at any distance, and on moveable

<p class='c007'>In the transmission of news, market reports, etc.,
as a continuous process a long strip of paper of typewritten
copy is put into this machine, and the blacks
and whites of the letters and figures falling on the
light sensitive cell open and close a C. W. broadcast
or wire circuit; which at distant points is translated
back into light and recorded on a long strip of photographic
paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>This can be a continuous process if the sending
strip is added too from time to time, and the receiving
photographic strip of paper, as it is exposed, passes
continuously through a developing, fixing, washing
and drying bath. This process might be required by
the conditions of service. A white strip and an
electric pen may be used instead of photo paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sending machine the rotating prisms sweep
the image of the typewriter line across the light
sensitive cell; and the strip is moved longitudinally
by winding on a drum.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the receiving machine the strip is drawn along
while it is curved around a rotating cylinder inside
which the modulating light is located, turned off
and on by radio. A corona glow lamp is preferably
employed with the photographic paper.</p>

designed for simultaneously sending and receiving
photograms, letters, maps, drawings, etc. The motor
runs all day long, like an electric fan, in control of
the vibrating fork. The right hand (glass) cylinder
sends; and the left hand cylinder receives. The
messages are put on and taken off without stopping
the machine, and without one function interfering
with the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>The machine may be used on radio or on wire, and
is an easily operated machine, the perfect functioning
of which can be determined by a glance at the
perforated rotating disc illuminated by the synchronizing
signal lamp.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is believed to be the first duplex two-way service
machine ever built, and is complete as shown, except
for the batteries and the radio receiving set, which
latter may be any standard set which will operate a

the simplest device possible for the experimental
study of transmission of pictures and picture messages
by radio or by wire. A conducting ink or
pencil line on paper and put on one cylinder (or an
insulating coating cut through with a stylus) over
which the sending point rides for sending; and an
electrolytic bromide (or photo) paper on the other
cylinder under the receiving pen for receiving; the
contact points being attached to the sending and the
receiving sets respectively.</p>

<p class='c008'>The upper illustration shows a machine electrically
driven and equipped to transmit and receive handwritings,
maps, sketches, pictures, etc., of an area
of about 5 × 7 inches. The sending is from pencil
lines on paper, the reception on electrolytic paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>The machine is also made with a glass cylinder to
send from a picture transparency, and to receive on
photographic paper. It must, therefore, be used in
a dark or subdued lighted room to receive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The machines here shown are the laboratory models
used in the development of Radio Vision and Radio
Movies for the reception in the home of broadcast
studio performances, i. e., dancing girls, public
speakers, pantomime, marionettes, motion pictures;
and, by remote control, outdoor events, sports, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lower illustration shows a 10″ disc rotating
in front of a prismatic ring, synchronized by a
variable speed of the motor. The light is in the
round box at the top of the standard behind the lens
carrier, and shines through lenses and prism (onto
a picture screen) as they pass, the light fluctuating
in value with the incoming radio signals to make up
a complete picture every one-sixteenth of a second.</p>

<p class='c008'>The upper illustrated mechanism differs from the
lower one in that it has a second overlapping prism
for optical correction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The casing enclosing the mechanism is not very
large, and contains, besides the radio vision mechanism,
the radio receiving set, and a loudspeaker, so
that an entire opera in both action and music may
be received.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>The Jenkins High Speed Camera</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This camera was designed for the study of high
speed motions; i.e., the flight of birds, recoil of guns,
the impact of shell on plate, muscular activity of
athletes, airplane behavior, mechanical motions, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The normal rate of exposures is 1,000 to 3,000
pictures per second (4,000 pictures per second have
been made).</p>

<p class='c008'>It uses standard motion picture super-speed negative
film. Prints from these negatives are made in
any standard motion picture printer, and developed
in the usual way.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prints may then be projected in any standard
motion picture projecting machine, giving an apparent
reduction of 100 to 200 times in the speed of movement
of the object photographed, and therefore
easily studied.</p>

<p class='c008'>The camera is fitted with 48 Zeiss Tessar lenses,
F-3.5 and 2″ focus, and is driven by an automobile
starting motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It weighs approximately 100 pounds, and therefore
easily moved from place to place. (Weight of two
6-volt automobile batteries additional.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Sunshine is adequate for illumination. If artificial
illumination is employed, it should be equal to
sunshine.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<span class='sc'>Note</span>: The explanation of the unusual speed possible
with this camera lies in its lens system, for each
lens may work as much as 150 per cent of the time;
that is, the exposures overlap.)</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>The Genesis of Radio</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><i>A Broadcast from WRC, November 20, 1924</i></div>
    <div class='c004'><span class='sc'>C. Francis Jenkins</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The history of radio is unique—at first only a
scientific curiosity, and for years thereafter a
boy’s plaything; when, all at once, without warning,
the public takes it up with a suddenness no one
foresaw, and for which no one was prepared.</p>

<p class='c008'>An invention which behaves so peculiarly excites
one’s curiosity to a study of its strange attraction;
and of the beginnings of the scientific principles
involved, now so knowingly discussed by mere
youngsters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why, boys in the whole range of their ’teens discourse
with fluency and understanding such mysteries
as inductance, impedence and capacities; reactance,
reluctance and rotors; harmonics, aerials, and
mush; choppers, chokes and cheese; heterodyne,
neutrodyne, and iodine; and we oldsters don’t know
whether they are talking of medicine, music or food.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only thing that saves us from everlasting embarrassment
is that we have the gumption to keep
our mouths shut.</p>

<p class='c008'>So, determined to be ready for these “kids” the
next time they come into my august presence, I
start in to “bone up” on some of these funny words,
and for a start I turn to a musty volume printed by
Congress in 1879.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears that on January 16 of that year the
business of Congress was stopped, and, in solemn
procession, led by the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chaplain,
and the Vice-President, the Senate proceeded
to the House chamber, where the Speaker handed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>his official gavel to the Vice-President, who said:
“The Senators and Members of the Congress of The
United States are here assembled to take part in
services to be observed in memory of the late Joseph
Henry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, as I read the addresses made on that memorable
occasion, and look up the references cited, I get
the solution to my problem.</p>

<p class='c008'>I find it was Joseph Henry who first discovered
that breaking the circuit in a coiled wire “gives a
more intense spark than the same wire uncoiled.”
And so inductance was born, and later in his honor
we name its unit of measure a “henry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he put iron inside the coil and got the first
magnetic field; next he found that when he arranged
a second similar coil near the first, the spark appeared
in a gap of the second circuit, and so we have the
first transformer.</p>

<p class='c008'>He put parallel metal plates across the circuit, and
he had a condenser; and finally he separated the
circuits by many hundred feet, and the first radio
signals were broadcast and picked up.</p>

<p class='c008'>So we learn that to this modest but remarkable
man we owe the simple coupling coil that the boys of
the past twenty-five years have been using to telegraph
to each other wirelessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>And it is these American youngsters who have
developed radio; who first set up two-way communication
half-way around the world; who, through
their Radio Relay League, kept Captain McMillan
in touch with home during his long winter night in
the Arctic ice; who kept the <i>Shenandoah</i> in constant
contact with headquarters in Washington during her
recent transcontinental trip, official acknowledgment
of which was publicly made by the Secretary of the
Navy.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Radio eventually will touch our lives at more
points directly and indirectly than any other discovery
in the history of mankind, unless, perhaps, I
should make an exception in favor of fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the delightful thing about it all is that the
inaccessible places are benefited the most by radio,
those in the out-of-the way places are less lonesome,
and the long day of the sick and shut-in is
more endurable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The farmer has his market reports on the minute,
his weather forecasts in time for action, and he sets
his clock by radio and gets his entertainment from
the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dispatched and guided by radio, the flying mail
goes day and night with such clocklike regularity
that its remarkable performance is no longer “news,”
although industry has not yet waked up to the advantage
and economy which can be effected by a
larger use of the airmail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ships are guided into harbor through fog by wireless
direction, and the captain was guided thereto by
radio compass and radio beacon, and at sea summons
aid in case of mishap or danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>In commerce one may send letters, telegrams,
bank drafts, or engineer’s drawings, as radio photographs
of the originals, with photographic accuracy
and autographic authenticity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men on the ground talk with men in a flying machine
out of sight in the sky, an almost inconceivable
fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>This reason alone would warrant one in predicting
that the defense of our country is definitely going to
pass from the limited activities of the Army and
Navy to an Air Department, for the plane has no
boundary or limit of range in offense or defense.</p>

<p class='c008'>And in addition there is the wireless direction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>bomb-dropping airplanes, torpedo submarines, and
floating mines, inanimate agencies obeying the
distant, unseen hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>And ultimately power will be transmitted to
populous areas, over wireless channels, from the
enormous unworked coal fields away up in the Arctic
Circle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The applications of radio are coming so fast in
industry that it is hard to keep informed, but doubtless
its most extended use will be in the home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use of microphone modulated radio to carry
music and speech to our homes celebrated its fourth
anniversary only two weeks ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet in this brief space (<b>1</b>) millions on millions
have been entertained with the very best the artist
has to offer; (<b>2</b>) a singer has been heard around the
world; (<b>3</b>) and our President has addressed his fellow
Americans as a single audience.</p>

<p class='c008'>When onto the boundless range of audible radio
is grafted the world-wide appeal of the picture,
the ideal means of entertainment would seem to have
been attained, for the picture is without language,
literacy or age limitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>By radio we shall see what is happening in a distant
place; inaugural ceremonies, football, baseball or polo
games; flower festival, mardi gras, or baby parade.</p>

<p class='c008'>So when the development of radio as a service to
the eye has progressed to a like extent with ear-service
radio, we will bring the entire opera to your
home in both acting and music, or even the Olympic
games from across the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been most satisfying to have had a part in
the development of this wonderful medium of contact
between individuals and between nations. My
part being principally visual radio, I expect great
things from Radio Vision.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>And did you ever notice the curious fact that a
great laboratory, despite its inestimable contributions
to science and engineering, has never yet brought
forth a great, revolutionary invention which has subsequently
started a new industry, like the telegraph,
telephone, and telescope; motion picture, typecasting
and talking machines; typewriter, bicycle and locomotive;
automobile, flying machine, and radio vision.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has always been a poor man to first see these
things, and as a rule the bigger the vision the poorer
the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, do you know, that is right comforting, too;
for I sometimes think that perhaps I myself may yet
do something worth while if I only stay poor enough,
long enough.</p>

<p>Note: As Washington is the birthplace of radio, and has been the birthplace of more revolutionary inventions, upon which great industries have been built, than any other ten-mile territory, it may be interesting, and appropriate, to add here a recount by Mr. Jenkins of Washington’s claims to intellectual stimulus.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Washington is the home of our Federal
Government; but it is more than that—it is a
delightful place to work, a stimulus to excellence in
mental activity. Those of us who had wandered
about more or less aimlessly before we discovered
Washington well understand how its genial climate
called forth the Presidential praise of our honor guest
from the cool, green hills of Vermont.</p>

<p class='c008'>Add to the delight of the climate, the charm of
Washington’s setting, and one appreciates why,
from the Executive Mansion outward to the very
rim of federal activity, all remain, if they can, after
leaving office. Woodrow Wilson stayed here, until
he passed away. President Harding was hurrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>home when his end came. The only living ex-president
resides in the District.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abraham Lincoln was loath to leave Washington,
it is said, and so preferred a summer cottage in the
Soldier’s Home Grounds, as did many of his successors,
rather than a more elaborate executive residence
elsewhere, while the White House was getting
its annual dressing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the house now occupied by the Cosmos Club,
Dolly Madison ruled social Washington in such a
scintillating setting that even the widows of presidents,
with few exceptions, have made their later
homes here.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is it strange, for this is the city the unequaled
plan of which was worked out with such loving care
by Major Charles L’Enfant, as he leaned over a
drawing board in his home near the old Tudor Mansion;
the parks of the plan later beautified by the
landscape gardener, Andrew J. Downing.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this magnificent dream city had the proper
antecedents, too, for it was from this very site the
old Indian chief Powhatan ruled his own vast territory
before ever the white man had set up the capital
of a nation dedicated to peace and opportunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many eminent statesmen and great orators have
found Washington environs so satisfying that they
have spent their last years within this forest-like
city. The inimitable Henry Clay was buried here
in 1852; Elbridge Gerry, a signer of the Declaration
of Independence, lies in the Congressional Cemetery;
and John Lee Carroll, a former Governor of Maryland,
found his last resting place in a local graveyard.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in Washington as the head of the Federal
Party that that distinguished orator, Daniel Webster,
made his indelible impress on American history.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the old “Union Tavern” on a site now occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>by a large apartment building one could have
found hobnobbing with resident genius, in that
early yesterday, such guests as Louis Phillipe, Count
Valney, Lord Lyons, Baron Humboldt, Charles
Talleyrand, Jerome Bonaparte, Washington Irving,
Charles Dickens, General St. Clair, Lorenzo Dow,
John Randolph, and perhaps Charles Goodyear,
when he was asking for a patent for vulcanizing
rubber.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the dashing Robert E. Lee, leaving his ancestral
home overlooking Washington, rode regretfully
away to duty in his beloved south.</p>

<p class='c008'>One may perhaps concede that associations would
attract retired admirals and generals to a residence
here—Admirals Evans, Dewey, Schley, Sampson,
Peary, and Generals Greely, Crook, Wheeler, Miles
and Pershing, within my own unprompted memory,
but what is the secret which brings back to Washington
those who have looked upon the enchanting spots
of our wonderful country; the three Johns, for example,
John C. Freemont, the great northwest pathfinder;
John W. Powell, explorer of the Grand
Canon of the Colorado; John A. Sutter, discoverer of
gold in California.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even Governor Shepherd, who <i>made</i> Washington,
and afterward was practically banished to Mexico,
prayed that he might be brought back to the city of
his dreams, and his wish gratified, he lies at rest
amid the grassy slopes of Rock Creek Cemetery.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was ever thus; even stubborn old Davy Burns
must have thought well of Washington for he brought
from his native land not only a charming daughter
but the bricks with which he builded a cottage for
her, and from whose humble door this Scottish
lassie later went to a haughty family and a mansion
as the wife of Major General Van Ness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Not only from official life, but from all fields of
activity, the capital city attracts to itself an unusual
aggregation of mentality—scientific and literary and
industrial.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poets and great writers, noted scientists and renowned
inventors have done their best work in the
invigorating atmosphere of the capital, washed clear
by the mist of the Great Falls of the Potomac.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was here Francis Scott Key lived when he
wrote “The Star Spangled Banner,” a spot marked
by the new memorial bridge just completed; here
Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote that immortal story,
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin”; Walt Whitman the first edition
of his “Leaves of Grass”; James Bryce “The
American Commonwealth”; and Owen Meredith his
“Lucile.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In a rose-covered cottage on the heights overlooking
the river, across from the Arlington National
Cemetery, Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth wrought;
and in a less flowery abode impecunious Edgar Allan
Poe wrote much of his “spooky stuff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking down upon the city from the east, John
Howard Payne, in tranquil contentment, on his
return from a sojourn in a foreign land, wrote the
one song which will never die, “Home, Sweet Home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In isolated serenity in Rock Creek Park stands the
cabin of Joaquin Miller, “the poet of the Sierras,”
now the shrine of the artist as well as the writer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Across Lafayette Park, opposite the White House,
George Bancroft, the great historian, calmly laid
down his pen in his 91st year and passed to his great
reward.</p>

<p class='c008'>And it was here that the painter James McNeill
Whistler began his climb to an artistic, world-renowned
fame.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for science, why Washington is the scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>center of the world. More revolutionary discoveries
which have been the foundations of great industries
have been made in the District of Columbia than
any other ten miles square in all the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was here that the great Joseph Henry spent the
most prolific period of his sixty years of usefulness.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the bosom of Rock Creek, Fulton first floated
the model of his steamboat, the <i>Clermont</i>; and on the
Potomac River, Professor Langley tested out the
aerodynamic principles upon which all airplanes are
built, and at a time when the “flying machine” was
a subject not mentioned in elite scientific circles.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the observatory on Cathedral Heights, that
great astronomer, Simon Newcomb, worked; and
nearby Cleveland Abbe, the famous meteorologist,
published the first daily weather reports.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between Washington and Baltimore, Professor
S. F. B. Morse, in 1844, put his telegraph to work,
the first telegraph operator being Theodore N. Vail,
late president of the A. T. &#38; T. Company. Dr.
Graham Bell perfected his telephone here, Professor
Tainter the wax cylinder phonograph, and Mr.
Berliner the talking machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both the typecasting machines, the linotype and
monotype, were invented in the District; and here
a stenographer in the Life Saving Service invented
the first motion picture machine, the prototype of
the projector used in every picture theatre the world
over to this very day.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the hills of Virginia, across the river, the first
wireless message ever transmitted was sent into
Washington; and from Washington to Philadelphia
the first photographs by radio were sent.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Daughters of the American Revolution
sought a permanent home no place could successfully
compete with the charm of Washington; and here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>also the American Red Cross and the Pan American
Union set up their respective domiciles.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Kendall Green Park, in the northeast section
of the city, the Columbia Institute for the Deaf was
set up, the only Institution of its kind in the world,
the gift of Gallaudet to the afflicted.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in Washington that another philanthropist,
William W. Corcoran, built the Louise Home for
Southern gentlewomen, as well as the Corcoran Art
Gallery, the latter a gift to the city. He was laid
away in Oak Hill Cemetery, the resting place of an
unequaled gathering of distinguished Americans.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the north of the city is the Walter Reed Hospital,
named in honor of Dr. Walter Reed, who
heroically risked his life to prove that yellow fever
germs were communicated by mosquitos.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Carnegie Institute “for the encouragement of
investigation, research and discovery,” and the
Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory are both located
here.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Washington the Geographic Society was established,
and the unique <cite>Geographic Magazine</cite> is published;
and here the beautiful home for the National
Academy of Science has just been dedicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>So the atmosphere of Washington works its
witchery on resident as well as those who stop here
but briefly, a mental stimulus of no uncertain
potency; and as for scenic beauty, it is unequaled
and getting more beautiful and more attractive all
the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>As I fly above the city its streets are hidden under
a criss-cross of green trees, with the superb white
dome of the Capitol standing out above the verdure
in majestic splendor; and over to the west the Lincoln
Memorial, looking for all the world like a jewel box
of alabaster. And on the rim of the mist beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>stands a bowl-like marble amphitheatre keeping
watch over the grave of the Unknown Soldier, while
still farther around to the north looms the great
National Cathedral on Mount St. Albans, where lies
“the man of peace.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And it was this inspiring sight that greeted the
homeward bound, round-the-world flyers as they
glided over the city to a landing in Boiling Field.</p>

<p class='c008'>An annual pilgrimage to this mecca of glorious
past and wondrous present, with its wealth of white
buildings, its miles of park roads, its spring cherry
blossoms and autumn colors is always inspiring.</p>

<p class='c008'>From whatever point of view, Washington well
deserves the pride of possession of all worthy
Americans.</p>

<p>Every normal man instinctively seeks a recreational activity—hunting, fishing, riding, tennis, golf. The author’s relaxation from research work is flying an airplane—and it’s delightful sport.</p>
